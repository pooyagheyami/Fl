From the business aspect, you would need to ask yourself some hard questions. You have created a product and now you need to move from the creator/ inventor thinking and go into a businessman thinking. You need to do the business yourself, because you cannot shift that function to someone else. It doesn't work that way. Even if you go into a partnership and your partner says he'll take care of business while you take care of the invention / product development part, you still need to know about business. Just so you are aware of what is happening and you can make sure no one cheats you and leaves you with nothing although it is your invention.

So you have to learn about business.
Here are some questions for you:
1. What is the RM40k for? - what is the investment for? - a prototype or to manufacture a certain number of units
2. Who is your target market?
3. Is this product already available in the market? - are you offering a better or cheaper product?
4. What are your sales projection - one year, three years, five years? How many people are likely to buy this? - people are already using the keyboard to type Tamil script so why would they want to get a new one? do they need to keep switching keyboards each time they want to move from keying Tamil script to Roman letters? How are people in Tamil Nadu doing this?
5. What is your revenue? How soon will you be able to see profits? Investors are always looking for 10-15% return on investment by the third or fifth year of operations. Do you think you can start making money quickly?
6. Need a breakdown of the costs involved - ie costs to set up and costs to operate (per month/year).

Most important question, what is the problem your product is going to solve? Is there really a problem? Is the market going to accept your product right away?
If there is a problem and your product will solve it, then sales will be easy. No need to spend too much money on marketing and promo.
